## HLS examples

Performs histogram equalization and filtering on input video using HLS OpenCV libraries.

The code works but a lot of stuff is commented out because this was actually a snippet of a bigger project.

The convolution operation used for the simple kernel in this example is overkill and has only been used to show how Filter2D works.
